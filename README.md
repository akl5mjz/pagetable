# pagetable

To customize the page table layout, open the config.h file and adjust the values of LEVELS and POBITS. For LEVELS, any positive integer value can be used. Note that higher levels increase the complexity of the page table and may impact performance. For POBITS, other values can be used, such as 9 or 16. Note that smaller page sizes may lead to more fragmentation, while larger page sizes may result in more wasted space.

One example use case for this code could be in the development and testing of operating systems or other software that involves memory management. The simulation of a multi-level page table lookup and allocation provided by this code can help developers understand and test the behavior of memory management in their software under various conditions.

Currently, the code only partially implements the API defined in mlpt.h. Specifically, it provides a functioning translate() function, but the page_allocate() function has not yet been implemented.
